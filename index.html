        <p>The <i><b>Beagle</b></i> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <i><b>beagle</b></i>
            was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
            tracking instincts, the <i><b>beagle</b></i> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural
            imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <i><b>beagle</b></i> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to
            its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</p>
